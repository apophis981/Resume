\opening{To who it may concern:} 
 
\noindent I am applying for the position of Test and Verification Software Engineer which is available on SpaceX's website: spacex.com/careers.php. I am currently attending 
Earlham College, and coming this May, I will graduate with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Physics.
 
\noindent In high school I participated in a FIRST robotics team for all four years serving as team captain my Junior and Senior years. I enjoyed the experience of working on a complex system which involved the
integration of software and hardware. I recieved a great deal of satisfaction when our team completed our robot on time. I am hoping to find a job which would provide me 
with an experience similar to the one I had with FIRST, and I expect that I would find such a work environment at SpaceX.

\noindent The skills and experience I have acquired at Earlham, the internships I have had, and my experience with FIRST robotics I believe have prepared me for this position. The introductory 
computer science courses taught at Earlham cover C++ and as a result, the majority of my programming experience has been using C++.  I have since worked on projects such as 
creating my own shell and making a multi-threaded server which require low-level operations which C has and C++ does not have. I took a robotics course in which all of the 
programming was in Python. Throughout my computer science education at Earlham, I have written countless shell scripts and have used Perl extensively. I gained experience 
using CVS and SVN version control software in my work study job maintaining the computer science website at Earlham and in group projects such as building an interpreter 
from scratch.

\noindent For the past two summers I have interned at Woodward HRT. While there I tested software on it's own circuitry and reported runtime statistics along with any errors which 
had occurred. I also compiled and debugged source code for some of their projects in order to make their code up to MISRA standards. 

\noindent I am excited to see that experience in a Linux environment is required for this position because most of my experience as a software developer has been in a Linux
environment. 
 
\noindent I am attaching my final report on my senior project. It describes how I wrote a hand gesture interface for control of a flying quadrocopter. 
This week I am on spring break and am at my grandfather's house in Frazier Park, CA. I can be reached at (661) 245-1547. After Sunday the 18th of March, I will be 
back at school where I can be reached via cell phone above.
